The Three Little Pigs

Once upon a time, three little pigs set out to build their own homes. 
The first pig quickly built a small house of straw. It was easy and fast, 
but not very strong. The second pig built a house of sticks. It looked 
better than the straw house, but it was still weak. The third pig worked 
hard and built a solid house of bricks, which took more time but was very strong.

One day, a big bad wolf came. He blew down the straw house with one breath, 
and the first pig ran away. Then he blew down the stick house, and the second pig 
escaped too. Both pigs ran to their brother’s brick house. The wolf tried and tried 
to blow it down, but the brick house was too strong.

Angry and tired, the wolf gave up. Safe inside, the three little pigs laughed 
and celebrated. They learned that hard work and patience create strong foundations, 
and from then on they lived happily together in the brick house.
